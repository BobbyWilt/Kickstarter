# Kickstarter Team Project

This project utilizes a dataset of over 100,000 data points of kickstarter company data.  A neural network with a 91% accuracy score is trained and tuned to predict if a kickstarter company is successful.  The pre-trained model is saved and deployed to our custom-made flask app which will display predictions and data visualizations for the success status of kickstarter companies.  To facilitate processing speed, the initial dataset was converted to a mySQL database and in accessed via MongoDB in the flask app.  Additionally, the flask app is deployed to a Heroku server that anyone can access and generate kickstarter success predictions.
