# Kickstarter Team Project

This team went above and beyond to shape and support the architecture of the project, they also helped deployment of the related pipelines. The team also contributed meaningfully to aspects of the deployed project beyond Data Science, smoothed out conflicts, and significantly contributed to explaining the project to non-DS people beyond the team.

The Kickstarter App Takes a dataset provided by Kaggle. The team used advanced cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, encoding, splitting, and scaling methods to model and train a neural network project. This app uses early stopping to prevent some of the over-fitting problems associated with these kinds of models; the training stops if the validation loss is not improving for three epochs and returns to the best weights the model had. We used class weights to get better performance from the model, based on the skew of the imbalanced classes.
